    <h2>OneInOneOutOSC Arduino Sketch</h2>

    <p>This example is intended as a starting point for adding low-latency
      hardware-level computing on an Arduino coupled to dynamic code (e.g. Pure
      Data or Python) on a laptop or Raspberry Pi. The communications between
      the Arduino and the host uses the OSC protocol (&quot;Open Sound
      Control&quot;) over a USB serial port.</p>

    <p>OSC is an extensible message-based protocol. The particular OSC message
      scheme implemented in this sketch is similar to the SerialOscuino scheme,
      but simplified for clarity.</p>

    <p>Please see the comments in the code for more details on the messaging
    scheme.</p>

    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

    <p>This sketch assumes that the CNMAT OSC Arduino library has already been
      installed in your Arduino IDE.</p>

    <p>The library is available
      at <a href="https://github.com/CNMAT/OSC">github</a>. The most general way
      to obtain the library is to <em>clone</em> the library using git
      from <a href="https://github.com/CNMAT/OSC.git">the library master
      branch</a>, as this would allow updating your installation to incorporate
      upstream changes. Alternatively you
      can <a href="https://github.com/CNMAT/OSC/archive/master.zip">download a
      zip file of the current library
      version</a>. More <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git">help
      on git can be found at github</a>.</p>

    <p>Libraries are installed in the Arduino IDE by copying them to the
      libraries/ subfolder of your sketch folder. If you have a library in a zip
      file, this can be done via the Sketch/Import Library/Add Library menu. If
      you have a regular folder of files, it can simply be manually moved into
      the libraries/
      folder. The <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries">Arduino
      tutorial on library installation can be found at the main Arduino
      site</a>.</p>

    <p>Once the library is installed, the sketch can be compiled and downloaded
      as usual to the Arduino. Be sure to note the serial port name, as that
      will need to be supplied to the code on the host. The name can be seen and
      selected on the Tools/Port menu.</p>

    <p>Open Sound Control is an open protocol implemented by many commercial and
      open-source systems. It is most commonly used to transport messages over
      an IP network rather than a serial port. Specific applications such
      as <a href="http://www.tuio.org/">touch-based user interfaces</a> define
      specific message naming schemes to be carried within the OSC protocol.</p>
