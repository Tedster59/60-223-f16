    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>The <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> is a powerful
      microcontroller which runs the Linux operating system.  We are using the
      B+ version, which has 512&#160;Mb RAM and a 40-pin connector for hardware
      I/O.  It boots from a microSD card which acts as its hard drive.  It is
      about as powerful as a low-end cell phone, which puts it orders of
      magnitude more complex than an Arduino, but much less capable than a
      current laptop.</p>

    <p>The Raspberry Pi is a vastly more powerful computer than the Arduino and
      has access to a vast array of Linux software, much of which is easily
      available in packaged form.  It makes it possible to easily embed computer
      vision, audio processing, networking, data logging, 3D graphics, web
      services, etc. in a small device.</p>

    <p>The downside of this is increased complexity.  Unlike the Arduino, it
      takes a few tens of seconds to boot up.  Programs can be written using
      many languages but the programming environment generally lacks the
      simplicity of the Arduino IDE.</p>

    <p>We have tried to bundle a rich set of tools in a standard system to make
      it as easy as we can to get started.  We have the [wiringPi] object for Pd
      which can directly control hardware I/O pins.  For those so inclined, the
      wiringPi-Python library allows easy programming in Python.  If you want to
      blend the two, the [pdpython] object enables building mixed systems.  And
      it is also possible to program in C, C++, Javascript, Perl, e.g., any
      major language available for Linux.</p>

    <h4>Interaction with the Pi</h4>

    <p>This exercise is about becoming familiar with the infrastructure and
      getting to the point of basic usability.  There are a couple of different
      ways in which people use the Pi:</p>

    <p><b>As a standalone computer.</b>  It is possible to plug a monitor,
      keyboard, mouse, and network port directly into a Pi and just treat it
      like a desktop computer.  The upside is the relative simplicity of getting
      started and the possibility of generating 3D graphics directly on a
      monitor.  The downside is that the Pi is a slow computer, and burdening it
      with generating a desktop display makes it feel slow.  Plus needing all
      the accessories defeats some of the point of using a tiny computer.  We
      only recommend this mode as a startup step or for a disconnected system
      off the network.</p>

    <p><b>As a X11 client.</b> The X11 system dates back to the 1980s but is
      still a viable means for running graphical user interfaces across the
      network.  The laptop runs an X11 server (e.g. XQuartz.app) which handles
      drawing on the screen on behalf of a program running on the Pi,
      communicating over the network via SSH. This method works well for running
      Pure Data on the Pi from a laptop.  This method can work over WiFi, but is
      much more reliable on a direct Ethernet connection.</p>

    <p><b>As a SSH server.</b> Much of the Pi can be operated from the command
      line.  An ssh client on a laptop can connect to the Pi for an interactive
      console session.  This works over even a slow network connection, and
      works fine for text editors with console modes (e.g. emacs).</p>

    <p><b>As a remote desktop.</b>  It is possible to use a standard remote
      desktop interface on a laptop to open the Raspberry Pi desktop as a
      window.  This can be familiar, but also can feel slow since the Pi is
      still generating a full display.  The advantage is the minimal amount of
      hardware, since the only accessory needed is a network connection.  This
      is really only a usable method across a direct Ethernet connection; the
      WiFi will be unusably slow.</p>

    <p><b>As a Web server.</b> We have installed Node-RED, which can be launched
      to provide a web-based programming interface.  This is not used in the
      course exercises, but might be viable for advanced students seeking to
      integrate the Pi hardware with web services.</p>

    <h4>Data Storage on the Pi</h4>

    <p>We have installed an updatable image of the course materials on the Pi
      microSD, so it should be possible to work through the exercises as-is.
      But once you begin copying the templates and generating your own project
      code and data, you'll want ways to get your personal files on and off the
      Pi.</p>

    <p><b>Using shared folders.</b>  We have set up a Samba server on the Pi
      which allows drag and drop file access from a laptop.</p>

    <p><b>Using a USB drive.</b>  The Pi can mount filesystems from USB sticks
      and external hard drives.</p>

    <p><b>Using a SFTP client.</b>  Desktop and command-line SFTP clients
      (e.g. Fugu.app or sftp) can remotely access the Pi filesystem.  In many
      ways, this is more reliable than the Samba system, since there is no
      persistent connection.  Sftp is better for transferring individual files
      rather than nested folders.</p>
    
    <p><b>Using rsync or unison.</b> These are programs which perform single- or
      bi-directional file synchronization between a laptop and the Pi, but which
      require some careful configuration.  These are suitable for nested folders
      and large sets of files.</p>

    <h4>Maintenance of the Pi</h4>
    
    <p>The Linux system on the Pi is a complex infrastructure involving many
      parts which can be individually updated.  Your program is always one of
      many.</p>

    <p>We have provided an update system (the 'puppet' system) which can help
      with keeping your Pi up to date as the course evolves.</p>


    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>

    <p>We will walk through these steps as a class demonstration, since there
    are many steps which are hard to document.</p>

    <p><b>Preparation.</b> Gather the materials listed above.  Install your
      microSD card.</p>

    <p><b>Getting connected.</b> If using a cluster laptop, install the Ethernet
      adapter and attach an Ethernet cable from it to the Pi. </p>

    <p><b>First contact using ssh.</b> If using a cluster laptop, configure as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open System Preferences/Network and configure the Thunderbolt Ethernet
	as follows: Configure IPv4 Manually, IP Address 192.168.2.1, Subnet mask
	255.255.255.0.</li>

    <li>Open System Preferences/Sharing and enable Internet Sharing so the
      laptop can bridge the Pi to the internet.  Enable the "Internet Sharing"
      setting and set it to share from Wi-Fi to Thunderbolt Ethernet.  </li>

    </ol>

    <p>Attach power to the Pi and watch the lights flicker as it boots.  Try a
      command-line ssh connection from a Terminal window.  The Pi is
      preconfigured to use address 192.168.2.3, so from a Terminal window try
      the following: <code>ssh pi@192.168.2.3</code>.  If successful, you'll see
      a password prompt: the default password is <code>raspberry</code>.  If
      successful, you'll see a Linux command prompt.  Try <code>ls -l</code> to
      get a listing of files.</p>

    <p><b>First contact using monitor.</b> If using a monitor, connect the HDMI
      monitor, USB keyboard and mouse, and then attach power to the Pi.  You
      should see a stream of boot messages on the screen culminating in a login
      prompt.  The default username is <code>pi</code> and password
      is <code>raspberry</code>.  If successful, you should see a Linux
      desktop.</p>

    <p><b>Graphical operation using X11 over ssh.</b> If using a cluster laptop,
      log out of the console connection, and the log back in with the -X
      flag: <code>ssh -X pi@192.168.2.3</code>.  You'll again see a Linux
      command prompt.  Try the <code>xterm</code> command; the laptop should
      automatically launch XQuartz and open a window with a terminal emulator.
      If that works, try the <code>pd</code> command; it should launch Pure Data
      with windows appearing on the laptop.</p>

    <p><b>Updating using the puppet system.</b> If using a cluster laptop, try
      the following command to check your network connectivity: <code>ping
      www.cmu.edu</code>.  If that fails, you'll need to debug the network
      connection.  The <code>ifconfig</code> command will show you the current
      network configuration on the Pi.  Other useful network
      commands: <code>hostname -I</code> to check the current IP
      address, <code>host www.cmu.edu</code> to test name service, and <code>dig
      www.cmu.edu</code> to test name service in detail. (For details: <code>man
      dig</code> to read the manual page).</p>

    <p>If your Pi is able to connect to the internet, try running an update
	with <code>sudo pi_update --course</code>.  That will update the
	contents of the <code>/opt/cmuphyscomp/physcomp-examples/</code> folder
	to the current course materials.  To run all available updates, you may
	use <code>sudo pi_update</code>, but that can take a few minutes.</p>

    <p><b>Graphical operation using RDP.</b> If using a cluster laptop, launch
      "Remote Desktop Connection.app" and enter 192.168.2.3 for Computer.  You
      may need to confirm Connect at a security warning.  You should then see a
      Login to xrdp window, enter pi and raspberry as username and password.  It
      should then proceed to show a Linux LXDE desktop within the RDC window.
      You can log out using the red button at lower right.  It is also possible
      to use "Microsoft Remote Desktop.app": you'll need to create a new
      connection but leave the Credentials section blank.</p>

    <p><b>Getting files on and off the Pi using Samba.</b> If using a cluster
      laptop, open a Finder window and look under the Shared list on the
      sidebar.  Select raspberry and click Connect As.. and enter the
      pi/raspberry username and login.  It should open a folder representing the
      pi home folder on the Pi; you can drag and drop to copy files back and
      forth.</p>

    <p><b>Resizing the filesystem.</b> The course system image is sized to fit
      on a 4Gb card, but has likely been written to a card larger than 4Gb.  You
      can check whether it has been properly expanded to make use of all
      available space by running <code>df -h /</code> and seeing whether the
      size column still says 3.6G or is a larger number commensurate with your actual
      card.  If it needs to be resized, run <code>sudo raspi-config</code> and
      select
      <code>1 Expand Filesystem</code> at the menu, followed by interface
      item <code>Finish</code>, then confirm an immediate reboot.</p>

    <p><b>Shutting down the Pi.</b> It is best to do a proper shutdown on the Pi
      rather than just unplugging it to avoid corrupting the memory card.  From
      a command line enter <code>sudo shutdown -h now</code>.
