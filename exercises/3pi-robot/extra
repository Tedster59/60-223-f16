    <h2>Exercise: Bench, Battery, Grid</h2>
<h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Learn basic electrical safety, recognize AC and DC sources, learn scale
      of voltage units.</p>

    <p>Caution: this lesson involves measuring dangerous voltages from the AC
      wall outlets.  Please observe meter settings carefully and avoid touching
      any exposed metal.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Set the DMM to VDC.  Place probes on a 9V battery as shown. Observe
	reading.  It should show approximately 9 volts.</li>

      <li>Reverse the probes on the battery.  Observe reading. It should be the
	same magnitude with reversed sign.</li>

      <li>Find an incandescent lamp.  The lab stocks a grab-bag of lamps with
	different voltage ratings.  Touch leads of lamp to battery contacts.  If
	the lamp doesn't light, try a smaller one.  If it burns out, try a
	larger one.</li>

      <li>Reverse lamp leads.  It should still light: incandescent lamps have no
	polarity.</li>

      <li>A 9V battery has a low enough voltage that it won't cause much current
	flow through dry skin. However, now is a good time to start building the
	habit of not touching wires or leads, and instead using a meter to check
	potentials.</li>

      <li>Note: the lab doesn't have enough power supplies for every student
	pair to work with their own; please share, multiple circuits can be
	connected in parallel to each supply.</li>

      <li>Set the DC power supply to 9 Volts.</li>

      <li>Repeat DC voltage measurements between red and black terminals.</li>

      <li>Connect the lamp to the power supply terminals.</li>

      <li>Trying varying the power supply voltage up and down by 2 Volts.  Check
	the voltage using the DMM, not just the power supply display.  Observe the
	response of the lamp.</li>

      <li><b>Caution</b>: the following step calls for measuring the AC wall outlet
	voltage.  Line power has a high enough voltage to be fatal, so think
	through how to make contact safely without any chance of exposed metal
	contacting your body.</li>

      <li>Set the DMM to VAC.  Outlet voltage is alternating current for power
	delivery, so this configures the meter to measure the <em>RMS</em>
	voltage.</li>

      <li>Double-check that the probe connectors are inserted into the probe
	ports for voltage measurement, NOT current measurement.</li>

      <li>Carefully touch the probe tips to the metal blade contacts inside the
	outlet.  Observe the reading, it should be approximately 120.</li>

      <li>Repeat between each blade contact and the round grounding contact.
	Observe readings.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>Our typical sensor circuits will all use DC supply voltages ranging from
      3.3 to 12V.  Our typical actuator circuits will use DC supply voltages from
      5V to 12V.  Many electronic components have tightly specified supply voltage
      ranges and will malfunction or be destroyed outside that range. </p>
