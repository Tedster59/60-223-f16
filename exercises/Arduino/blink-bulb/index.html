    <h2>Exercise: Blink Bulb</h2>
<h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Drive a light bulb from an Arduino program.</p>

    <p>A microcontroller isn't very useful without some kind of hardware
      attached.  This exercise introduces driving an incandescent bulb from a
      digital signal.  The transistor is used as a switch to control a higher
      current flow through the bulb than the Arduino output pin can sink, and at
      a voltage unsafe for the Arduino.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Adjust the lamp power supply for a safe full-on voltage. (Many lab
	incandescent lamps are designed for less than than the 12V shown on the
	schematic.)</li>Load and run the Blink sketch from Examples/01.Basics.

      <li>Note that pin 13 is still connected to the onboard LED.  Observe the bulb and LED activity.</li>
      <li>Add additional <code>digitalWrite()</code> and <code>delay()</code> statements to create a different blink pattern.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>This simple example cannot drive two separate patterns on two pins
      simultaneously, since it just stalls during <code>delay()</code>.  Much of
      the challenge of programming a multi-function Arduino program comes down
      to structuring control flow so the program never stalls so it can service
      multiple inputs and outputs simultaneously.</p>

    <p>For a challenge, restructure this program to use <code>millis()</code> to
      test for the loop cycles on which to change the output state, then add a
      second channel of output with different timing.  This will covered in more
      detail in a later exercise.</p>
