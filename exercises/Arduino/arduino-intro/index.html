    <h2>Exercise: Arduino Introduction</h2>
<h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Understand the basic nature of an Arduino; find the Arduino software tools.</p>

    <p>The <a href="http://arduino.cc/"><em>Arduino</em></a> is a tiny computer
      with specialized hardware suitable for physical interfacing and easy
      programming.  Or rather, there
      are <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Boards">many variants</a> available
      in different configurations which share a common programming system and
      design philosophy.  We'll focus on the basic Arduino Uno.</p>

    <p>The Arduino runs programs from built-in FLASH read-only memory.  When
      powered up, it boots very quickly and starts running the stored program.
      This is convenient for physical interfacing; the world doesn't wait for
      booting up.  It is low-power and works reasonably well with battery
      supplies.  It has built-in analog-to-digital conversion for reading analog
      sensor inputs.  It can generate pulse-width-modulated (PWM) signals for
      operating servos and motors.  It doesn't have any sort of graphic display,
      so understanding and debugging program flow requires a host computer and
      careful reasoning from the limited data that can be sent to it.</p>

    <p>The Arduino comes with a software application called the Arduino IDE
      (or <em>Integrated Development Environment</em>) which combines a program
      text editor, a <em>compiler</em> which translates the program text into
      machine code, and a <em>bootstrap loader</em> which can program the
      machine code representing your program into read-only memory on the
      Arduino microprocessor.</p>

    <p>The identity of the Arduino is rooted in the programming language as
      defined by the supplied libraries.  The underlying language is C++, but
      the built-in libraries use a selected subset of C++ to keep the syntax
      beginner-friendly.</p>

    <p>The computational capacity of an Arduino is vastly smaller than a
      contemporary laptop or cellphone: the Arduino Uno has only 32K of ROM and
      2K of RAM, executing 8-bit instructions at 16&#160;MHz.  The laptop
      computer used to write this text has 8&#160;million times more persistent
      storage and 4&#160;million times more transient storage.  Computation
      rates are harder to compare, but the basic clock rate of this laptop is
      80&#160;times faster, and the effective processing rate even more
      multiplied.  But the Arduino consumes substantially less power, and is
      substantially easier to program at a hardware level.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Familiarize yourself with
	the <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno">Arduino Uno</a>:
	find one in the lab, look at the physical and electrical interfaces,
	read the specs, look up any unfamiliar nomenclature.</li>

      <li>Find and launch the Arduino application.  If you are using your own computer, 
	<a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">the IDE can be installed
	from the main Arduino site</a>.</li>

    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>The IDE package actually contains all of the source code for the
      libraries, so with a little digging it is possible to read everything that
      is compiled and loaded.</p>

    <p>The <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/uploads/Main/arduino-uno-schematic.pdf">Arduino
	Uno circuit diagram</a> can help with understanding all the parts on the
	board.  There are actually two microcontrollers, with one devoted to the
	USB connection, and the other running user programs and interfacing to
	the pins.  The 3.3V supply is provided by a linear regulator attached to
	the 5V supply.  The power supply automatically switches between USB and
	external power.  The USB supply is fused to try to protect the attached
	computer from short circuits.</p>
