    <h2>Exercise: Input Matching</h2>
<h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Understand a simple pattern recognition state machine expressed as an
      Arduino program using several idiomatic C/C++ program structures.</p>

    <p>This is a very simple single-input binary pattern recognition system.
      However, even this state machine could be used to recognize synchronous
      inputs from a communications channel.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Set up an Arduino UNO with a 10K pullup resistor on PIN4 and a switch
	connecting PIN4 to ground, e.g. a simple binary input sensor which you
	can operate.</li>

      <li>Upload the InputMatcher1 program found in this folder.</li>

      <li>Open the Serial Console and set to 115200 baud.</li>

      <li>Observe the console messages and the onboard LED.  Can you deduce an
	input sequence which will get to State 3 and turn on the LED?</li>

      <li>Examine the code; you will be comparing this program structure to the
	following two versions.</li>

      <li>Repeat the test for InputMatcher2 and InputMatcher3.</li>

      <li>Choose a new pattern for the system to recognize, and choose the input
	example you prefer to modify.  Rewrite the finite-state machine to
	recognize the pattern of your choosing.</li>

    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>This same recognition exercise could be extended to any binary input:
      optical switches, wall contact switches.  It could also be extended to any
      possible sampling rate, including cycling loop() as fast as possible.</p>

    <p>The transition properties could be extended to include other predicates:
      comparisons on elapsed time to prevent exiting a state before time has
      elapsed, more elaborate mappings of linear inputs to transition
      state.</p>

    <p>You may now recognize that the switch debouncing code introduced much
      earlier is a specific case of a finite-state machine implementing
      time-based hysteresis.</p>
