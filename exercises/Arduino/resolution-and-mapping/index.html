    <h2>Exercise: Resolution and Mapping</h2>
<h4>Objective</h4>
 
    <p>Filter a control input to control an audible signal and explore signal precision.</p>

    <p>Digitized signals are represented by a finite number of bits and thus are
      discretized in value as well as time.  However, there is a often a
      tradeoff between time and resolution, since multiple samples of a
      measurement can be combined over time.</p>

    <p>This exercise continues with audible signal generation since our ears are
      very sensitive to subtle changes of pitch.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    <ol>

      <li>Start from your result from the previous exercise: a circuit reading
	a potentiometer input and mapping the voltage to a change in the
	frequency of two audible speaker outputs.</li>

      <li>Adjust the mapping function until a one-unit change in the input is
	enough to create an audible step.  Adjust the update rate to
	approximately 2&#160;Hz so each input change creates a tone at about
	120&#160;BPM for ease of observation.</li>

      <li>Observe the effect of ADC noise on the pitch sequence.  Slowly move
	the potentiometer and observe the step changes in pitch for small input
	changes.</li>

      <li>Add a smoothing filter to the potentiometer input.  This can be as
	simple as a basic first-order filter:
	<pre>
	  static float smoothed_value = 0.0;                  // filtered value of the input
	  int new_value      =  analogRead( analogPin );      // read the current input 
	  float difference   =  new_value - smoothed_value;   // compute the 'error'
	  smoothed_value     += 0.1 * difference;             // apply a constant gain to move the smoothed value toward the reading
	</pre>
      </li>

      <li>Observe the resulting pitch sequence.  Increase the input sampling
      rate to decrease the convergence time for step inputs.</li>

    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>As a challenge, try adding a differentiator to the potentiometer input to map the change rate of the input to the pitch.</p>
