    <h2>Exercise: Photocell with bias resistor</h2>
<h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Measure changing light level as a varying voltage.</p>

    <p>A <em>CdS photocell</em>
      (i.e. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cds_cell">Cadmium-Sulfide
      photoresistor</a>) is a light sensor in which the resistance
      changes in response to illumination.  They are relatively slow, with a time constant of hundreds of milliseconds, but useful
      for measuring ambient light and shadow.  The resistance decreases in bright light.</p>

    <p>A voltage divider circuit can be used for forming a voltage which depends
      on the light level.  The value of the fixed resistor depends upon the
      desired sensitivity range; a good starting point is 10K ohms.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    <ol>

      <li>Measure the resistance of the photocell over different illumination conditions.</li>
      <li>Measure the photocell voltage in the given circuit over different illumination conditions.</li>
      <li>Using the oscilloscope to observe the photocell voltage, try creating
	rapidly changing shadows to estimate the response speed.</li>
      <li>Construct a simple setup to indirectly measure a physical property
	using a photocell.  This can be as simple as using paper to occlude the
	light sensor as a function of mechanical position. (Keep this simple,
	this should only take a minute or two.)</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>Rapid light changes and optically encoded data are better measured with
      phototransistors and photodiodes.  But even slow and cheap light sensors
      can be adapted to measure many other properties indirectly,
      e.g. chemicals, dust, mechanical position, acceleration, proximity,
      etc.</p>

    <p>For a challenge, find one of the laser diodes and measure the photocell
      response to the laser beam.</p>
