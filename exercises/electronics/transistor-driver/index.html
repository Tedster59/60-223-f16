    <h2>Exercise: Transistor Driver</h2>
<h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Amplify a control signal using a transistor.</p>

    <p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor">transistor</a> is a
      type of three-terminal semiconductor component which allows a control
      current or voltage at the <em>base</em> or <em>gate</em> terminal to
      affect the current flowing through the device.
      A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSFET">MOSFET</a> is a particular
      type of transistor with very high current gain; the gate input has very
      high impedance, such that a gate voltage with very little current can
      control the current flowing between the <em>source</em>
      and <em>drain</em>.  This makes it very convenient for interfacing
      logic-level signals to loads such as motors.</p>

    <p>MOSFETs have a linear range in which the current is proportional to the
      gate voltage, but this exercise will use it in a <em>saturation</em> mode
      in which it is either on or off.  MOSFETS come in both P-channel and
      N-channel varieties exhibiting different polarities; this exercise uses an
      N-channel MOSFET in which a small positive gate voltage relative to the
      source terminal will cause a positive current to flow from drain to source,
      activating the motor.</p>

    <p>MOSFETs have very low forward voltage, i.e., the voltage drop across the
      source and drain can be very low, meaning there is very little power
      dissipated for a given current.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Set the power supplies to the specified voltages first.  We are using
	a low-voltage motor (the vibrating motors in the lab) so the 2V is actually the &#8216;high-power&#8217;
	energy supply and the 5V is the logic supply.  The MOSFET can handle
	substantially higher currents than used by this motor.</li>
      <li>Manually connect and disconnect the gate voltage, observing the motor
      operation.  If disconnecting the gate does not turn off the transistor,
      try grounding the gate.  Even a small static charge on the gate can be
      enough to turn it on.</li>
      <li>Measure the gate current and resistance, and compute the power
      dissipated by the gate input.  (It should be very low.)</li>
      <li>Measure the motor current, and compute the power dissipated by the motor.</li>
      <li>Compute the power gain of the amplifier: the output power divided by the input power.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>
    
    <p>MOSFETS are fast and silent.  Modern MOSFETS can handle relatively high
      power loads with minimal dissipation.  The parts are polarized, and
      driving an output with both positive and negative current (e.g. for
      directional control) requires multiple parts and steering logic, e.g. an
      H-Bridge configuration.  The polarization also makes them unsuitable for
      controlling AC circuits.  More details can be found on
      the <a href="http://www.irf.com/product-info/datasheets/data/irf540n.pdf">data
      sheet for the IRF540 MOSFETs we stock in the lab</a>.</p>

    <p>Note that the MOSFET symbol includes a
      reverse-biased <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zener_diode">Zener
      diode</a> which exists as a byproduct of the transistor structure.  If the
      voltage across the MOSFET becomes sufficiently reversed, it will begin to
      conduct (&#8220;avalanche&#8221;) and can be destroyed.  This circuit has
      no apparent negative voltages, however, the motor coil is an inductor
      which can create negative voltage spikes as it turns off.  With larger
      motors in particular, it can be important to place
      a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyback_diode">protective clamp
      diode</a> around the motor which normally does not conduct but turns on to
      absorb large reverse voltages.</p>
