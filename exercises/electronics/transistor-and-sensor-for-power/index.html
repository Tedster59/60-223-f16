    <h2>Exercise: Linear One-In One-Out</h2>
<h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Connect light to motion via electricity.</p>

    <p>This exercise uses a single-input single-output system which couples a
      light level to a motor activation.  A photoresistor modulates the base
      current of a bipolar transistor, controlling the current flowing through
      the collector and emitter to operate a motor.  This represents one
      possible minimal solution to the first graded assignment.</p>

    <p>This is an analog circuit inasmuch as the photoresistor current can be
      set to keep the transistor operating in a linear range, continuously
      varying the motor speed.  If the base current is high or low enough, the
      transistor will either saturate or shutoff and act as a digital device in
      that it will simply be ON or OFF.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Wire up the circuit, trying to use only the schematic.</li>
      <li>Modulate the incident light, observing the motor, trying to find the
      linear operating region.  If necessary, adjust the supply
      voltages.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>This circuit takes advantage of the voltage resistor from an earlier lesson.
     The photoresistor is in series with a bias resistor. As the resistance of the
     photoresistor changes, the voltage of the transistor's ground pin relative to the
     source pin (tied to ground) changes. This changes the amount of current that is
     allowed to pass through the transistor, which in turn limits the speed of the motor.</p>

    <p>The two 5.6k resistors in parallel are used to create an equivalent reistance of 2.8k.
     As mentioned in the photoresistor with bias resistor exercise, different bias reisitor values
     allow for different sensivity ranges for the photoresistor. Here the resistor value was found
     through trial and error in order to create a voltage divider where the transistor is off when 
     the photoresistor is uncovered, and on when it is covered. If your circuit is not working, try
     changing the bias resistor value (lower values will be more sensitive).
     </p>
    <p>This circuit is a very simple example of
      a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier#Class_A">class-A
      amplifier</a> using
      a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common-emitter">common-emitter
      topology</a>; there are many other types of amplifying transistor
      circuits.  In general we will use PWM to control motor speed using a
      simple type of class-D amplifier for better power efficiency.</p>
