    <h2>Exercise: Linear One-In One-Out</h2>
<h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Connect light to motion via electricity.</p>

    <p>This exercise uses a single-input single-output system which couples a
      light level to a motor activation.  A photoresistor modulates the base
      current of a bipolar transistor, controlling the current flowing through
      the collector and emitter to operate a motor.  This represents one
      possible minimal solution to the first graded assignment.</p>

    <p>This is an analog circuit inasmuch as the photoresistor current can be
      set to keep the transistor operating in a linear range, continuously
      varying the motor speed.  If the base current is high or low enough, the
      transistor will either saturate or shutoff and act as a digital device in
      that it will simply be ON or OFF.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Wire up the circuit, trying to use only the schematic.</li>
      <li>Modulate the incident light, observing the motor, trying to find the
      linear operating region.  If necessary, adjust the supply
      voltages.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>In practice, transistor circuits usually have additional <em>bias
      resistors</em> to supply positive or negative currents to keep the
      transistor operating in the desired region. This is a deep topic which
      leads into the art of analog circuit design.  For an idea of this, look up
      &#8220;audio circuits&#8221; on Google Images
      and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=audio+circuits&amp;tbm=isch">see
      what comes out</a>.</p>

    <p>This circuit is a very simple example of
      a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier#Class_A">class-A
      amplifier</a> using
      a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common-emitter">common-emitter
      topology</a>; there are many other types of amplifying transistor
      circuits.  In general we will use PWM to control motor speed using a
      simple type of class-D amplifier for better power efficiency.</p>
