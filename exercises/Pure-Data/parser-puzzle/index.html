    <h2>Exercise: Parser Puzzle</h2>
<h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Understand a simple state machine expressed as a Pd graph.</p>

    <p>This is a purely computational exercise, but paves the way for attaching
      external inputs to a finite-state machine.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the parser-puzzle.pd Pure Data patch in the same folder as this file.

      </li><li>Click the green input buttons in the right order until the yellow win
	indicator is activated.  It shouldn't be too hard to figure out. :) The
	game is trivial, but if the inputs were coming from a sensor the graph
	could directly model a sequential process.</li>

      <li>The finite-state machine is implemented using the state_node.pd
	abstraction, which is instantiated six times across the bottom of the
	puzzle patch with different creation arguments.</li>

      <li>Look inside the state_node.pd abstraction.  Note the messaging buses
	used to broadcast messages to all states to signal when to store new input
	values, evaluate the inputs, and signal the state transitions.</li>

      <li>An alternate version is implemented below using six instances of the
	graphical_state abstraction.  This uses visible transition edges,
	although some of the logic is still implemented using buses.</li>

    </ol>
