    <h2>Exercise: Arduino Sensor to Pure Data GUI</h2>
<h4>Objective</h4>
 
    <p>Using PureData for reading, playing, recording, and scratching audio files</p>
    <p>Digital audio recordings are made up of a series of sample values; the audio sample rate for the recording establishes how many sample values are recording in teach second of town. For example, 44.1KHz, 44,100 samples are recorded every second.</p>
    <p>Puredata uses tables (like those uses to store pitches and amplitudes for a melody) to store audio samples. The <em>tabread4~ </em>and <em>tabwrite~</em> objects allow reading and writing of values into tables at audio rates.</p>
  <p>Consider the follwoing important concepts, implications and questionsof this example:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>You can use tables and arrays in Puredata to work with audio samples</li>
      <li>The speed at which you play an audio file affects its perceived pitch </li>
    </ol>

  <h4>Steps and observations</h4>

  <ol>
      <li>Open the music-synth-sampling.pd patch in Pd-extended.</li>
      
    <li>Follow the institutions in the patch.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>
    
    <p>For a challenge,</p>
    <ul>
      <li>record and audio sample and play it back at 1/2 the origianl speed</li>
      <li>create a patch that <em>scratches</em> a sound back and forth with an oscillator</li>
    </ul>
      <h4>Other Files</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="music-synth-sampling.pd">music-synth-sampling.pd</a></li>
