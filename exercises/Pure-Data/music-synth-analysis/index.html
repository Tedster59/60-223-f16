    <h2>Exercise: Arduino Sensor to Pure Data GUI</h2>
<h4>Objective</h4>
 
    <p>Using PureData for advanced audio synthesis and anlysis. </p>
    <p>If a trumpet and a flute play the same note, at the same loudness and in the same register (octave), the differences that remain between the sounds are the <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre">timbre</a></em>. This exersize explores ways of synthesizing and analyzing the frequency contents of an audio signal.</p>
  <p>Consider the follwoing important concepts, implications and questionsof this example:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Sounds in the real-world are complext audio signals made-up of many frequencies at once</li>
      <li><em>Noise</em> contains equal amounts of all frequencies</li>
      <li>We can synthesize sounds by <em>taking out certain frequencies</em> from <em>noise</em></li>
      <li>We can analyze an audio signal with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">Fast Fourier transform</a> to compute its spectral contents</li>
    </ol>

  <h4>Steps and observations</h4>

  <ol>
      <li>Open the music-synth-analysis.pd patch in Pd-extended.</li>
      
    <li>Follow the institutions in the patch.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>
    
    <p>For a challenge,</p>
    <ul>
      <li>how does the sound of a sawtooth wave (</li>
      <li>what doe the spectrum of white noise look like?</li>
      <li>connect a sequencer (from the previous exercise) to the <em>synth</em> in this exercise</li>
      <li>use the series of <em>line</em> objects and <em>delay</em> objects to create f</li>
    </ul>
